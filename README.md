# Multi-fidelity density estimation via importance sampling

This GitHub repository contains the R code for the paper titled "Sampling low-fidelity outputs for estimation of high-fidelity density and its tails "

by Minji Kim, Vladas Pipiras, Kevin O'Connor, and Themistoklis Sapsis, Feb 2024.

The repository includes the following files:

* ``scripts`` : A directory containing the primary code for multi-fidelity importance sampling.

* ``simulation.Rmd`` : This file handles data generation and the creation of figures for numerical simulations.

* ``figs_intro.R`` : Contains the code necessary for generating introductory figures.

* ``ship.Rmd`` : Used for data analysis and producing figures applicable to the ship motion program.
