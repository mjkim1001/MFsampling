# Multi-fidelity density estimation via importance sampling

This GitHub repository contains the R code for the paper titled "Sampling low-fidelity outputs for estimation of high-fidelity density and its tails "

by Minji Kim, Vladas Pipiras, Kevin O'Connor, and Themistoklis Sapsis, Feb 2024.

The repository includes the following files:

* ``scripts`` : This directory is the core of our project, containing the main scripts for implementing multi-fidelity importance sampling techniques.

* ``figs_intro.R`` : This script is to create the introductory figures.

* ``simulation.Rmd`` : An R Markdown document that outlines the process of data generation and the steps involved in our numerical simulations.

* ``Figure_final.R`` : A script designed to generate the final set of figures showcasing the results of our numerical simulations.

* ``ship.Rmd`` : An R Markdown document focused on the application of our multi-fidelity importance sampling method to analyze ship motion program data.
